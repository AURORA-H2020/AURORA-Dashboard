AURORA is demonstrating how people can make a difference through the choices they make, reducing 13-20% of all greenhouse gas emissions linked to residential energy use and 13% linked to transport choices. In addition, the project will empower people to take ownership of new community solar energy projects.

## Purpose and Main Features

The AURORA Dashboard is designed to help users track and reduce their carbon footprint by monitoring their energy consumption and transportation choices. The main features of the dashboard include:

- Tracking energy consumption from various sources such as electricity, heating, and transportation.
- Providing insights and recommendations to reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions.
- Allowing users to participate in community solar energy projects.
- Visualizing data through interactive charts and graphs.
- Supporting multiple languages for a diverse user base.
